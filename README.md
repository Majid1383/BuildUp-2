**BuildUp** is an engaging 2D stacking game developed using Swift, CoreMotion and SpriteKit. The objective of the game is to stack blocks on top of each other to build a tall structure. As players progress through levels, the blocks decrease in size, increasing the challenge and excitement of the game. This project showcases the use of SwiftUI and game physics to create an interactive gaming experience.

Simple and intuitive gameplay mechanics.
Progressive levels with increasing difficulty.
Smooth animations and physics effects.
Beautiful graphics and sound effects (if implemented).
Easy-to-understand user interface.


**Technologies Used**
Swift: The programming language used for the game's development.
